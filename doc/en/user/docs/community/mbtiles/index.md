# MBTiles Extension

This plugin brings in the ability to read and write MBTiles files in GeoServer. [MBTiles](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/MBTiles) is an SQLite based standard format that is able to hold a single tiles map layer in a file.

MBTiles can both be used as a raster input datastore as well as an WMS [GetMap](../../services/wms/reference.md#wms_getmap) output format.
