# Vector data {: #data_vector }

This section discusses the vector data sources that GeoServer can access.

The standard GeoServer installation supports the loading and serving of the following data formats:

-   [Shapefile](shapefile.md)
-   [Directory of spatial files](directory.md)
-   [Java Properties](properties.md)
-   [GeoPackage](geopkg.md)

Other data sources are supplied as GeoServer extensions. Extensions are downloadable modules that add functionality to GeoServer. Extensions are available at the [GeoServer download page](https://geoserver.org/download).

!!! warning

    The extension version must match the version of the GeoServer instance.
