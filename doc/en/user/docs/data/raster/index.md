# Raster data

This section discusses the raster (coverage) data sources that GeoServer can access.

The standard GeoServer installation supports the loading and serving of the following data formats:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   [GeoTIFF](geotiff.md)
-   [WorldImage](worldimage.md)
-   [ImageMosaic](imagemosaic/index.md)
-   [GeoPackage](geopkg.md)

</div>

Other data sources are supplied as GeoServer extensions. Extensions are downloadable modules that add functionality to GeoServer. Extensions are available at the [GeoServer download page](https://geoserver.org/download).

!!! warning

    The extension version must match the version of the GeoServer instance.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   [ArcGrid](arcgrid.md)
-   [GDAL Image Formats](gdal.md)
-   [ImagePyramid](imagepyramid.md)
