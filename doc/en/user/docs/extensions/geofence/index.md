# Geofence Plugin {: #community_geofence }

[GeoFence](https://github.com/geoserver/geofence/) offers an alternative to the GeoServer [Security](../../security/index.md) subsystem of GeoServer, allowing far more advanced security configurations, such as rules that combine data and service restrictions. It uses a client-server model, and this plugin only provides the client component. It must connect either to an external Geofence server, or be used in combination with the GeoServer integrated Geofence server [Geofence Internal Server](../geofence-server/index.md).
