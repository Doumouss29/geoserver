# Services

GeoServer serves data using standard protocols established by the [Open Geospatial Consortium](http://www.opengeospatial.org):

-   The **Web Map Service** (WMS) supports requests for map images (and other formats) generated from geographical data.
-   The **Web Feature Service** (WFS) supports requests for geographical feature data (with vector geometry and attributes).
-   The **Web Coverage Service** (WCS) supports requests for coverage data (rasters).

These services are the primary way that GeoServer supplies geospatial information.
