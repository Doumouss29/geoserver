# WCS basics

GeoServer provides support for Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Web Coverage Service (WCS) versions 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0. One can think of WCS as the equivalent of [Web Feature Service (WFS)](../wfs/index.md), but for raster data instead of vector data. It lets you get at the raw coverage information, not just the image. GeoServer is the reference implementation for WCS 1.1.
