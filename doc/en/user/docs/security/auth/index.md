# Authentication {: #security_auth }

There are three sets of GeoServer resources involved in authentication:

-   The [Web administration interface](../../webadmin/index.md) (also known as web admin)
-   [OWS](../../services/index.md) services (such as WFS and WMS)
-   [REST](../../rest/index.md) services

The following sections describe how each set of GeoServer resources administers authentication. To configure the authentication settings and providers, please see the section on [Authentication](../webadmin/auth.md) in the [Web administration interface](../../webadmin/index.md).

-   [Authentication chain](chain.md)
-   [Authenticating to the Web Admin Interface](web.md)
-   [Authentication to OWS and REST services](owsrest.md)
-   [Authentication providers](providers.md)
