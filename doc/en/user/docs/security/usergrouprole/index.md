# Role system

Security in GeoServer is based on a **role-based system**, with roles created to serve particular functions. Examples of roles sporting a particular function are those accessing the Web Feature Service (WFS), administering the [Web administration interface](../../webadmin/index.md), and reading a specific layer. Roles are assigned to users and groups of users, and determine what actions those users or groups are permitted to do. A user is authorized through [Authentication](../auth/index.md).
