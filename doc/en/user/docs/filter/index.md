# Filtering

Filtering allows selecting features that satisfy a specific set of conditions. Filters can be used in several contexts in GeoServer:

-   in WMS requests, to select which features should be displayed on a map
-   in WFS requests, to specify the features to be returned
-   in SLD documents, to apply different symbolization to features on a thematic map.
