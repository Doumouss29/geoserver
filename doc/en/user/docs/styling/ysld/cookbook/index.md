# YSLD Cookbook

The YSLD Cookbook is a collection of YSLD "recipes" for creating various types of map styles. Wherever possible, each example is designed to show off a single YSLD feature so that code can be copied from the examples and adapted when creating YSLDs of your own. While not an exhaustive reference like the [YSLD reference](../reference/index.md) the YSLD cookbook is designed to be a practical reference, showing common style templates that are easy to understand.

The YSLD Cookbook is divided into four sections: the first three for each of the vector types (points, lines, and polygons) and the fourth section for rasters. Each example in every section contains a screenshot showing actual GeoServer WMS output, a snippet of the YSLD code for reference, and a link to download the full YSLD.

Each section uses data created especially for the YSLD Cookbook, with shapefiles for vector data and GeoTIFFs for raster data. The projection for data is EPSG:4326.
