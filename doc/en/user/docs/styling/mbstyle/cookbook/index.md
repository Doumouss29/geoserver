# MBStyle Cookbook

The MBStyle Cookbook is a collection of MBStyle "recipes" for creating various types of map styles. Wherever possible, each example is designed to show off a single MBStyle layer so that code can be copied from the examples and adapted when creating MBStyles of your own. While not an exhaustive reference like the [MBStyle reference](../reference/index.md) the MBStyle cookbook is designed to be a practical reference, showing common style templates that are easy to understand.

The MBStyle Cookbook is divided into four sections: the first three for each of the vector types (points, lines, and polygons) and the fourth section for rasters to come. Each example in every section contains a screenshot showing actual GeoServer WMS output, a snippet of the MBStyle code for reference, and a link to download the full MBStyle.

Each section uses data created especially for the MBStyle Cookbook, with shapefiles for vector data and GeoTIFFs for raster data.
